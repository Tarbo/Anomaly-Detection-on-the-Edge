\begin{abstract}
System logs and traces contain information that reflects the state of the 
System and provides a comprehensive insight into the workings of the embedded 
system. Moreover, logging of traces as a tool for monitoring the operation of 
an embedded system is recommended by most safety standard organizations. 
However, because the data can be overwhelmingly huge within a short space of 
time, the use of models that do not rely only on known signatures for online 
anomaly detection becomes difficult to use due to the challenge of processing 
such an enormous amount of data at runtime. Hence, the resort to the use of 
signature-based tools by most practitioners as an embedded system is inherently 
limited in memory and computation power.\par
In this paper, we introduce a distributed anomaly detection model that smartly 
identifies the requirements of an application and uses the information to 
intelligently provide simultaneous anomaly detection for multiple profiles by 
leveraging the cloud computing platform as an additional computational resource 
when needed. Intelligent decisions about \emph{which} part of the application 
runs \emph{where} is a function of both the embedded process 
\emph{requirements} and resource \emph{availablity} in the embedded platform. 
Our anomaly detection model is a multi-stage process which makes use of 
transfer learning by using the knowledge gained from the unsupervised deep 
learning part to the supervised clustering portion of the model. Long 
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks fitted with a recursive context input and a 
context-aware attention mechanism provide a learning process that traverses 
horizontally (present and past inputs) and vertically (present inputs). We test 
the performance of the anomaly detection model with publicly available datasets 
of multiple processes running concurrently and our model demonstrates both 
effectiveness and robustness in detecting the anomalous sequences while 
satisfying the timing and other constraints.
