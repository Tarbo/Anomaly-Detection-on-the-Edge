\begin{abstract}
System logs and traces contain information that reflects the state of the 
system and serves as a rich source of knowledge for system monitoring from the 
application to the kernel layer. And logging of traces as a tool for monitoring 
the operation of a cyber-physical system is recommended by most safety standard 
organizations. However, because the data can be overwhelmingly huge within a 
short space of time, the use of models that do not rely only on known 
signatures for online anomaly detection becomes difficult to use due to the 
challenge of processing such enormous amount of data at runtime. Hence, the 
resort to the use of signature-based tools by most practitioners. \par
In this paper, we introduce an anomaly detection model that uses intra-trace 
and inter-trace context vectors with stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks to overcome the challenge of online anomaly detection in 
cyber-physical systems. We test the performance of the model with publicly 
available datasets that reflect both the application and kernel layer behavior 
and our model demonstrates both effectiveness and robustness in detecting the 
anomalous sequences.
