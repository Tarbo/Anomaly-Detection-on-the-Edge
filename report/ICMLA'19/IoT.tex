\begin{abstract}
One of the multiplier effects of the boom in mobile 
technologies ranging from cell phones to computers and 
wearables like smart watches is that every public and private 
common spaces are now dotted with Wi-Fi hotspots. These 
hotspots provide the convenience of accessing the internet 
on-the-go for either play or work. Also, with the increased 
automation of our daily routines by our mobile devices via a 
multitude of applications, our vulnerability to cyber fraud 
or attacks becomes higher too. Hence, the need for heightened 
security that is capable of detecting anomalies on-the-fly. 
\par 
However, these edge devices connected to the local area 
network come with diverse capabilities with varying degrees 
of limitations in compute and energy resources. Therefore, 
running a process-based anomaly detector is not given a high 
priority in these devices because; 
\begin{enumerate*}[label={\alph*)},font={\bfseries}]
	\item the primary functions of the applications running 
	on the devices is not security; therefore, the device 
	allocates much of its resources into satisfying the 
	primary duty of the applications.
	\item the volume and velocity of the data are high.
\end{enumerate*}
Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a multi-node (nodes 
and devices are used interchangeably in the paper) ad-hoc 
network that uses a novel offloading scheme to bring an 
online anomaly detection capability on the kernel events to 
the nodes in the network. We test the framework in a Wi-Fi-based ad-hoc network made up of several devices, and the 
results confirm our hypothesis that the scheme can reduce 
latency and increase the throughput of the anomaly detector, 
thereby making online anomaly detection in the edge possible 
without sacrificing the accuracy of the deep recurrent neural 
network.
