\begin{abstract}
Kernel events contain information that reflects the state of the system and is 
a source of knowledge for system monitoring from the kernel layer. However, 
because of the huge volume of the trace data within a short interval, the use 
of online anomaly models is limited because of the constrained nature of 
embedded systems regarding the compute capacity and energy resource. Hence, the 
resort to the use of signature-based tools by practitioners. \par
In this paper, we introduce a distributed online anomaly model that uses a 
novel technique to leverage edge/cloud resources that complement the operation 
of the anomaly model.
